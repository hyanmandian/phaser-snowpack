# Phaser + Snowpack

> Just a POC with Phaser and Snowpack. This project was bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA). 

To play, just [click here](https://phaser-snowpack.now.sh/) and have fun! :D

I've made maps with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and all assets are provided by [Pixel Frog](https://pixel-frog.itch.io/) that has a lot of free awesome game assets.

## Controlls
